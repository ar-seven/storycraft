                    My name is Rita. I was playing in my room when my phone rang. I went to answer the phone thinking that my friend had called. The call was from NASA. A man said, “You have been chosen to become an astronaut and join our team.” He hung up.
                </p>
                 <br>
                 <br>
                <p>
                    I was astonished to get a call from NASA. It thrilled me to the core. I went running to my elder brother. His name is Raj. He was playing upstairs with our dog named Cuddles. He was fascinated by the call.
                </p>
                <br>                 <br>
                <p>
                    Although we were excited to get a call from NASA, we were surprised too. We received a letter the next day. It was an official call from the space agency. It mentioned that we have excelled in our studies and are the right candidates for a crucial Mars mission.
                </p>
                <br> <br>
                <p>
                    We packed our bags and went to the main office of NASA. We were greeted by Thomas, one of the mission’s astronauts. He took us in. He showed us our bunkers to sleep. He said, “Rest well for the day. Tomorrow, your training will begin early in the morning. Be ready.” We both were excited.
                </p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The next day, we woke up. We were given a special spacesuit to wear. We have to train wearing it the entire day. I swam in a thin channel with water flowing very fast for an hour. I also had to jump from a cliff to test my courage. I passed all the tests, and so did my brother with flying colours. Our training continued for three years straight.
